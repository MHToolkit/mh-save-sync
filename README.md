# MH Save Sync

Cross-platform, multi-emulator save synchronization for macOS and Android with
end-to-end encrypted snapshots and a self-hosted service.

This repository is in **research/alpha**. It must not be treated as a stable
backup product until the data-integrity gates in `docs/ROADMAP.md` pass.

## Safety invariants

- Local emulator saves remain in their original format and location.
- File watchers mark saves dirty; they never upload directly.
- Remote data is never written into a running emulator's save directory.
- Concurrent histories become conflict branches, never silent last-write-wins.
- A restore snapshots the current state before replacing anything.
- The service never receives recovery secrets or plaintext save contents.

## Repository map

- `crates/`: shared Rust domain, engine, crypto, adapters, client, server and CLI
- `apps/`: native macOS and Android shells
- `deploy/compose/`: self-hosted PostgreSQL and S3-compatible deployment
- `docs/research/`: evidence-backed research and experiments
- `docs/adr/`: accepted architecture decisions
- `scripts/`: reproducible development, backup and verification tools

## Status

Phase 0 research and contract freeze is the current gate. See
`docs/ROADMAP.md` after the feature branch is opened.
