# MH Save Sync

Cross-platform, multi-emulator save synchronization for macOS and Android with
end-to-end encrypted snapshots and a self-hosted service.

This repository is in **research/alpha**. It must not be treated as a stable
backup product until the data-integrity gates in `docs/ROADMAP.md` pass.

## Safety invariants

- Local emulator saves remain in their original format and location.
- File watchers mark saves dirty; they never upload directly.
- Remote data is never written into a running emulator's save directory.
- Concurrent histories become conflict branches, never silent last-write-wins.
- A restore snapshots the current state before replacing anything.
- The service never receives recovery secrets or plaintext save contents.

## Repository map

- `crates/`: shared Rust domain, engine, crypto, adapters, client, server and CLI
- `apps/`: native macOS and Android shells
- `deploy/compose/`: self-hosted PostgreSQL and S3-compatible deployment
- `docs/research/`: evidence-backed research and experiments
- `docs/adr/`: accepted architecture decisions
- `docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml`: REST/OpenAPI v1 contract draft
- `scripts/`: reproducible development, backup and verification tools

## Status

Phase 1 feature branch currently contains:

- evidence-backed cloud-save, crypto/conflict, emulator-matrix, write-timeline and self-hosting research drafts;
- Rust workspace for domain, crypto, engine, adapters, client, server and CLI;
- encrypted fixed-chunk fixture snapshots, DAG conflict preservation, safe restore gating and SQLite WAL metadata tests;
- PostgreSQL + S3/MinIO persistent service with signed device certificates,
  missing-set resumable uploads, checksum fail-closed writes, transactional
  CAS HEAD commits and readiness checks for committed object references;
- macOS Swift shell smoke, Android SAF/WorkManager/foreground-service shell,
  and generated UniFFI Kotlin/Swift bridge evidence.

Still not stable: real macOS↔Android↔second-emulator round trips, polished
export/import UX, upgrade/rollback benchmark, remote isolated deployment and
serverless bundle recovery remain open gates in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Five-minute local demo

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p save-cli --bin mh-save -- adapters
cargo run -p save-cli --bin mh-save -- crypto-vector
cargo run -p save-cli --bin mh-save -- crypto-device-fixture
cargo run -p save-cli --bin mh-save -- snapshot-fixture tests/fixtures/generic-save
swift run --package-path apps/macos MHSaveSyncMac
```

Android local build/lint, using Android Studio's bundled JBR when macOS has no
system Java:

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" \
  apps/android/gradlew -p apps/android assembleDebug lintDebug
```

Self-hosted local demo with external secret files:

```bash
secret_dir="$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync-compose"
mkdir -p "$secret_dir"
openssl rand -hex 32 > "$secret_dir/postgres_password.txt"
printf 'mh-save-sync-local' > "$secret_dir/minio_root_user.txt"
openssl rand -hex 32 > "$secret_dir/minio_root_password.txt"
chmod 600 "$secret_dir"/*.txt
printf 'MH_SAVE_SYNC_SECRETS_DIR="%s"\n' "$secret_dir" \
  > "$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync.env"
chmod 600 "$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync.env"

podman compose --env-file "$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync.env" \
  -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml up -d --build --wait
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18080/ready
python3 scripts/compose-e2e.py
python3 scripts/compose-resume-e2e.py prepare artifacts/compose-resume-state.json
podman compose --env-file "$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync.env" \
  -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml restart server
python3 scripts/compose-resume-e2e.py finish artifacts/compose-resume-state.json
```

Backup and destructive restore:

```bash
CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman \
COMPOSE_ENV_FILE="$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync.env" \
  deploy/compose/scripts/backup.sh

CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman \
COMPOSE_ENV_FILE="$HOME/Documents/Secrets/mh-save-sync.env" \
  deploy/compose/scripts/restore.sh "$HOME/Games/Backups/MHSaveSync/<run-id>"
```
